# Stock_prediction-using-linear-regression
# introduction

The objective of this project is to develop a stock price prediction model using a simple linear regression approach. The historical stock data of Apple Inc. (AAPL) is utilized for training and evaluating the model. The code leverages scikit-learn for machine learning functionalities, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib for data visualization.
# Data Preparation

The initial step involves loading the historical stock data from a CSV file (’trainset.csv’) into a Pandas DataFrame. The ’Close’ prices are extracted, and any missing values (NaN) are imputed using the median of non-missing values. This ensures that the dataset is clean and ready for further analysis.
# Exploratory Data Analysis

A crucial aspect of understanding the dataset is visualized through a matplotlib plot, showcasing the ’Close Price history’ over time. This plot provides an initial insight into the distribution and trends within the data, aiding in identifying any patterns or anomalies

# Model Training and Evaluation
The core of the code involves training a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn’s LinearRegression class. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the traintestsplit function. The code then iterates through multiple random data splits, training linear regression models and recording the best model based on the highest accuracy, measured by the R-squared score, on the test set. The best model is subsequently saved to a pickle file (’prediction.pickle’) for future use.

# Model Loading and Evaluation
In the event that a previously saved model exists, the code attempts to load it from the pickle file. Upon successful loading, the model’s accuracy is evaluated on a random test set, and the results are compared with the accuracy of the previously identified best model.

# Average Accuracy
To assess the model’s general performance, the code calculates the average accuracy over 10 random test sets. This is achieved by randomly splitting the data into training and testing sets multiple times, computing the R-squared score for each iteration, and finally averaging the results. This provides a more comprehensive understanding of the model’s consistency

# Results and conclusion
The final section of the code includes a visualization that compares the predicted versus actual stock prices based on the test set. This visual representation aids in gauging how well the linear regression model performs in predicting stock
prices

# Considerations and Recommendations
1.	The use of a simple linear regression model may not capture the intricaterelationships within stock price data. Exploring more advanced models, such as polynomial regression or machine learning algorithms, could enhance predictive performance.
2.	Thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering are essential formodel accuracy. Consider incorporating additional relevant features or normalizing existing ones.
3.	Evaluate the model on a more extensive test set and introduce a validationset during model training to prevent overfitting
4.	Regularly monitor the model’s performance over time, and update it withnew data to ensure its relevance in dynamic market conditions.
